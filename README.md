## Inspiration
During this pandemic period , Everyone has stay updated about the severity of the cases in their surroundings. There are many applications, websites, which spring on users with loads of information which sometimes may leave the user overwhelmed. Hence we decided to make an application which showcases only the required amount of basic information that the user wants to see so that they are well aware of the situation they are in and take the necessary precautions.

## What it does
